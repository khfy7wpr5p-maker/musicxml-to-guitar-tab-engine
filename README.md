# MusicXML to Guitar TAB Engine

A standalone, deterministic engine that converts supported MusicXML scores into playable six-string guitar tablature.

AI agents and development tools should begin with [AI_CONTEXT.md](AI_CONTEXT.md).

## Current state

Authoritative `main`: `e60426d841981011518ec04435f93b3e8a7d71b2`.

Current merged capabilities include:

- secure `.musicxml` / `.xml` input handling,
- single-pass XML parsing with immutable parsed representation,
- shared semantic parse across public preflight and conversion,
- centralized processing/resource limits,
- deadline, monotonic clock, cancellation, and runtime checkpoints,
- hostile-input regression coverage,
- immutable canonical music and TAB contracts,
- physical guitar candidate generation,
- deterministic cost model and dynamic-programming optimizer,
- public deterministic JSON, ASCII TAB, and TAB MusicXML serializers,
- internal `EngineError 1.0.0` convergence,
- public `ENGINE_ERROR_CONTRACT_VERSION` and `isEngineError(value)` detection boundary.

`EngineError` itself and internal writer/domain error subclasses are not package-root exports.

PEB-1 local validation passed 241/241 repository tests and 17/17 focused tests. GitHub-hosted PEB-1 jobs did not execute because GitHub reported billing/spending-limit restrictions; those jobs are not successful CI evidence.

## Processing pipeline

```text
MusicXML
  ↓
XML normalization + safety + ProcessingBudget
  ↓
ParsedMusicXmlDocument 1.0.0
  ├─ structural validation
  └─ monophonic semantic projection
          ↓
CanonicalMusicDocument
          ↓
physical guitar candidates
          ↓
deterministic cost model + optimizer
          ↓
CanonicalTabResult 1.0.0
          ↓
shared canonical validator
          ↓
JSON / ASCII TAB / TAB MusicXML
```

## Architectural rules

1. `CanonicalTabResult` is the single authoritative downstream TAB source.
2. Writers use `selectedPosition` and never rerun optimization.
3. The parser does not choose strings/frets.
4. Physical validity precedes any future learned component.
5. Deterministic optimization remains the required fallback.
6. Unsupported structures fail explicitly or generate explicit warnings.
7. Teacher review remains required for educational use.
8. External systems connect through explicit versioned contracts/adapters.
9. Learned systems may score only already-generated, physically valid candidates.
10. Learned systems may not mutate MusicXML, pitch, strings, frets, physical rules, validators, or canonical objects directly.

## Public package API

Current package-root exports include:

- `ENGINE_ERROR_CONTRACT_VERSION`
- `FretboardError`
- `PREFLIGHT_STATUS`
- `convertMusicXmlToCanonicalTab`
- `getPositionCandidates`
- `isEngineError`
- `positionToMidi`
- `preflightMusicXml`
- `serializeCanonicalTabResult`
- `serializeCanonicalTabResultToAscii`
- `serializeCanonicalTabResultToMusicXml`
- `validateMidi`

## Supported musical scope

- `score-partwise`
- one part / one staff / one voice
- monophonic notes and rests
- standard six-string tuning by default
- validated custom six-string open MIDI tuning internally
- frets 0–20 by default
- supported whole/half/quarter/eighth/16th and dotted values
- supported ties, beam metadata, inherited divisions/time signatures, pickup measures
- explicit unsupported-notation and unplayable-pitch handling

## Error boundary

`EngineError 1.0.0` remains internal. Consumers may use `isEngineError(error)` for caught package errors and inspect `error.code`, `name`, `details`, and `message`. Machine branching should prefer stable `code` values over message text.

## Approved controlled roadmap

1. documentation convergence after Milestone 3 + PEB-1
2. `GuitarConfiguration 1.0`
3. `Integration Contract v1`
4. `OptimizerObservation 1.0.0`
5. `PedagogicalFeatureVector 1.0`
6. `TeacherFeedback 1.0`
7. deterministic teacher-verified fingering benchmark
8. learned candidate ranking v1 — shadow mode
9. controlled learned ranking only after separate evidence and approval

`Integration Contract v1` will define the stable boundary between this deterministic core and external systems. It must not move HTTP, UI, PDF/OMR, Audiveris, SesliTab, or application-specific logic into the core engine.

## Project boundaries

This repository does not directly implement:

- PDF/image OMR,
- Audiveris,
- HTTP service,
- UI/PWA/mobile application,
- SesliTab integration,
- chords/polyphony/barre/finger assignment,
- multipart/multistaff selection,
- grace notes/tuplets,
- compressed `.mxl` input.

## Governance

`main` is protected with seven required checks, but current required-check enforcement reports `non_admins`; administrator-bypass hardening remains open. GitHub Actions billing/spending-limit restrictions also currently limit fresh hosted CI evidence for the latest PEB-1 merge.
